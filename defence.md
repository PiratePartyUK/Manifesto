Defence
=======

Defence of the realm is a primary responsibility of government.  The United Kingdom must be able to meet its own defence needs as well as its obligations to defend overseas territories and allies.  Whilst we are not in favour of so-called 'pre-emptive defence' or an aggressive defence posture, we realise that the UK must be ready to respond to aggression or threats to our way of life.   We firmly believe that our Armed Forces must be well equipped with the appropriate equipment for the tasks we ask them to undertake, and trained for the roles in which they find themselves.

The British Armed Forces are rightly regarded as the best in the world, and we must ensure that we take care of them to the best of our ability and use them only when absolutely necessary.  All members of the Armed Forces should be secure in the knowledge that the country will not desert them once they complete their terms of service.


Focus spending on conventional forces
-------------------------------------

We believe that whilst a limited nuclear deterrent is important, the UK's military spending should be focused on our conventional forces, especially on forces that can be rapidly deployed. Airborne forces, infantry and other front line units bear the brunt of operations in the 21st century and should be prioritised.

Any like-for-like replacement for Trident should be abandoned and instead a reduced number of our current warheads should have their operational lifespans extended. Further reductions should take place as other countries reduce the number of deliverable weapons they posses.


Nuclear arms reductions
-----------------------

Other countries have nuclear weapons, and some of them might be hostile to Britain at some point in the future. Therefore Britain should keep its nuclear weapons while other countries have them.

While it is unrealistic to expect that the world will abolish nuclear weapons overnight, it is more likely to do so over a longer time scale. To encourage this to happen, and to prevent conventional wars from becoming nuclear wars, the UK should seek to negotiate terms that will strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

We want to see a negotiated global cap on the number of nuclear weapons any treaty nuclear-weapon state may possess, which would automatically reduce every year according to a set schedule.  We would aim for provisions to make it attractive for states to not possess nuclear weapons and unattractive for them to possess them, as well as offer confidence-building measures for states that feel threatened by nuclear armed neighbours.

We should strengthen verification measures and inspection routines and ensure they apply equally to all states that posses nuclear weapons.


Logistical capabilities to meet our obligations
-----------------------------------------------

The United Kingdom must ensure that its defence logistical capabilities are sufficient to meet the obligations that we have or may be required to undertake.  Ensuring that the UK has sufficient independent air and sea-lift capacity is vital.  It is important that we are able to operate independently of our allies if necessary.


The Afghan theatre of war
-------------------------

We support the development and implementation of clear, concise and achievable goals for the UK and allied presence in Afghanistan, and the withdrawal of that presence as soon those goals have been met and the situation in the region becomes more stable.


Review and streamline military procurement
------------------------------------------

We will refocus defence procurement on the UK or joint UK-allied projects.  It is vitally important that costs are kept down and that delivery of weapons systems, vehicles, communications systems and other military procurement is both timely and that the delivered product is appropriate to the defined need. We will ensure that our troops have what they need when they need it.


Protect the UK from warfare against computer systemsÂ 
-----------------------------------------------------

The UK's computing infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to backdoor attacks, both by hostile states and possibly by non-state actors such as terrorist groups. We would argue that the threat is both large and increasing, and hard to counter.

To ensure that the UK is as ready to deal with any concerted attacks on its infrastructure and information systems it is critical that there is funding for research into the threats we face and how to counter them.

We support the development of an offensive cyber-warfare capability to ensure that we are capable of operating effectively in the event of a conflict.

Given the grave threat that the abuse or misuse of an offensive cyber-warfare capability, including our own,  might pose to the UK, we will ensure that there is full transparency of the principles employed in both offensive and defensive cyber-warfare capabilities and spending.  We will ensure that there is legislation to prevent the use of military cyber-warfare related equipment or techniques by the government within the UK or against British nationals overseas.
