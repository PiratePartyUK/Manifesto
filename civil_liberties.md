Civil Liberties
===============

It often feels like we live in a "say no first, ask questions later" society. Whether it's councils banning a 9 year old from blogging about school dinners or the government threatening to suspend social media, the Pirate Party has always stood up for freedom of speech.  The courts must not be used to block freedom of expression and knowledge, and a reform of libel laws is overdue to ensure this. The right to speak out is fundamental in democracy.

We must protect the right to protest, assemble and strike.

We do have the right to protect our private and family life. Wanting privacy is not a suspicious activity. The government is reviving Labour's plan to track all our email, web and phone contacts in a blanket 'snoopers' charter'. This is a wasteful intrusion. The Â£2 billion cost should be invested in digital infrastructure instead of surveillance of people's personal lives.

Everyone has a right to private and confidential communication. To ensure that, we need to introduce stronger data protection laws, and require companies that hold personal information to be clearer with data subjects about their rights and to apply a reasonable level of security to data.

Most importantly, it is time to claim back the 'commons', even on privately owned land that is used publicly.  We have the right to gather and enjoy our shared spaces and we should be free from arbitrary restrictions and intrusions if we wish to do so.  We want to see a rolling back of the more authoritarian excesses of the last few governments, including a review of terrorism legislation and laws designed to limit a specific type of behaviour, but that now have an impact on every day life and have come to threaten us all.

Support those who expose wrongdoing
-----------------------------------

The Pirate Party has shown its commitment to whistleblowers by being the only party to actively and consistently support Wikileaks. We will stand up for the rights of any whistleblower.

We recognise the value of whistleblowers to society and we will defend the right of citizens to expose illegal practices in the workplace and elsewhere.  We will introduce stronger protections for whistleblowers.  Exposing corrupt or illegal activities must take precedence over contract law and copyright law, and no-one should fear persecution for making the public aware of a breach of the law.

Reform libel law to bolster free speech
---------------------------------------

English and Scottish defamation law both need a thorough overhaul.  At present they present an unacceptable risk to free speech.  We will make it clear that the truth is an absolute defence against any defamation claim and significantly reduce the burden and costs faced by defendants in defamation cases.


Respect privacy
---------------

The privacy of the individual should be respected at all times.

We feel that citizens' right to private and confidential communication is vital, but at present it is not respected. We will forbid third parties from intercepting or monitoring communication traffic (i.e. telephone calls, post, Internet traffic, emails), and require specific warrants to be issued by a court before the police are allowed to monitor communications traffic.

We will ensure that the freedom to encrypt data and communications is not abridged or limited and that access to the tools that make secure communications easier is not restricted.

We will significantly strengthen data protection laws, ensuring that companies holding personal information give data subjects more information about their rights; apply a standardised minimum level of security to data; and are clear about their policies on data retention and amendment.

We will make it easier to apply to a court for compensation where data protection laws have been breached, and increase the penalties for any breaches of data protection laws.  We will allow the courts to apply these penalties to both the individuals and companies responsible, proportionally to the scale of the breach.

We will insist that searches of personal property should only be done with reasonable suspicion of a serious criminal offence, and that any targeted surveillance requires a warrant. We will also introduce an annual independent audit of all cases in which surveillance is used, using the results to ensure that any legislation that allows intrusive acts is no broader than absolutely required and is used appropriately.

We will introduce laws on the acceptable use of CCTV cameras in both public and private spaces. While we recognise that there are arguments for the use of CCTV under some circumstances, it should not be considered a replacement for police officers on the beat, and it must not be used as an excuse for unrestricted spying on the public.

We want clearer guidelines and restrictions on the use of DNA records by authorities, to ensure samples are only taken voluntarily, or when there are reasonable grounds to suspect the individual of having committed a serious offence. Samples should be promptly destroyed if the individual is acquitted or not charged with a criminal offence, and they should only be held for the length of time for which there is a reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed a crime. The guidelines should ensure that we follow European law on removal of DNA records.



Create a formal notion of pseudo-public space
---------------------------------------------

There's very little genuinely public space in the UK; whether you are looking for it online or offline,  but there are many places that are private and yet modern life strongly encourages you into, like shopping centres, walkways, parks and open spaces around churches and other buildings.

These spaces become so important to people, that it is time to recognising that citizens have rights in them, despite being private places.

The Pirate Party intends to define a legal notion of "pseudo-public space" which is space that, while privately owned, has become so woven into the lives of citizens, and so essential to their daily routines, that they any rights that they might enjoy in a public place also apply.


Protect the right to protest
----------------------------

The right to protest and express dissent without fear of reprisal is fundamental to a democratic society and the exercise of freedom of speech. The Pirate Party seeks to uphold and protect this right, wherever people wish to make use of it. Withholding labour is also part of the tradition of protest and must also be protected.


Require court order for any covert surveillance
-----------------------------------------------

Any body, including the police, should be required to obtain a court order in order to perform any covert surveillance of specific individuals.  Where obtaining a warrant would prevent the police acting on an immediate threat or pursuing a lead in an investigation, a court order should be obtained alongside the ongoing surveillance and, if denied, the subject of the surveillance must be informed. The court order required should be proportional to the amount of surveillance, the degree of the suspected offence and the amount of evidence against the individual.


Repeal bad laws
---------------

We know that there are many issues with the law in the UK, including laws that are either overly broad, poorly defined, or used for purposes for which they were not intended.  There are a number of obvious and grave issues that we would like to address as soon as possible.

We will repeal sections 63-66 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, These overly broad powers targeted at rave culture are targeted solely at electronic and dance music and allow police officers to arrest any individual they believe might be on their way to a rave within a certain area.

We will repeal section 49 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). Section 49 of RIPA makes it illegal to not surrender encryption keys when a notice is served, allowing a penalty of up to 2 years in jail.

Although this was originally a counter-terrorism law, it has been widely applied. A further section of the act (54) stops you telling anyone about the request for information from the moment you are given the notice.

We will repeal sections 142-149 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011. In a democratic society it is absurd that there are restrictions on protest in and around the seat of government.  We will remove specific provisions prohibiting protest around Westminster.

We will conduct a review of the Communications Act Section 127. Clarification of elements of the Communications Act are required to ensure that it is brought into line with how people use the Internet and modern electronic communications.  We should not live in a country where people are arrested for making jokes on social media platforms.

We will conduct a review of the 'Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005'.  When it was initially enacted, measures in the Act were opposed by a number of human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, JUSTICE and Liberty. Criticism of the Act included complaints about the range of restrictions that could be imposed, the use of closed proceedings and special advocates to hear secret evidence against detainees, and the possibility that evidence against detainees may include evidence obtained in other countries by torture.

Whilst some of these objections have been addressed, the issues they present remain.  A thorough review of terrorism legislation is again needed to ensure that we have the right powers to deal with the threat, rather than simply broader powers that leave us all a little bit less free.


Restoring Trust In Government
-----------------------------

Our democracy is in real danger. All too few people take part and vote. It's time to reverse the trend of just a few people calling the shots. This has to start with trusting young people and bringing in voting from 16. All the main parties promised us long overdue reform of the House of Lords, but seem unable to act due to Westminster bickering. Let's all be involved in working out how we want to be governed, based on equality and fair representation. When all else fails constituents should be able to force a by-election if they have lost confidence in their MP.

It is time to end the "pass the buck culture". It should be transparent who is responsible for which decisions and who will take responsibility when there are problems. We all take responsibility for our actions; it is time that those in government did so too.

We can't ask you to trust the government, but we can promise to work to make government more trustworthy. We should expand 'open data's. Government and council information that concerns us should be shared with us. If our government fails us, people should have the right to expose it and we should protect the rights of whistleblowers.

Freedom of Information laws must be protected, strengthened and expanded. The 'right to know' should apply wherever our money is being spent and that must include private contractors. We've seen how outsourcing can let us down with G4S security for the Olympics, so it is important that it is possible to renegotiate contracts or get rid of suppliers when they fail us.


Increase government transparency and accountability.
----------------------------------------------------

We will introduce a new right for constituents to force a by-election in the event of a loss of confidence in their MP.

We will require minutes of all meetings of officials on government business to be accessible through Freedom of Information requests. We will also aim to ensure that all available information that could be requested under a Freedom of Information request is made public by default.

We will require that all international treaties be passed through the UK parliament as a standard bill, requiring the full approval of both houses.


Votes at 16
-----------

Everyone is affected by government policy, but the disparity between representation and responsibility is greatest between those aged 16, who cannot vote, and those aged 18 who can.

Everything from education policy through to health and social policy can have an immediate effect on 16 year olds have no say in who represents them at a national and local level. At 16 a person can join the Army, but not vote. A 16 year old can work, but not vote. A 16 year old is old enough to be tried in a court and punished for breaking the law, but cannot vote.

Reducing the voting age will also increase the political and democratic engagement of young people. Getting younger people involved in the national debate early, ensuring that they have a stake and a say, should improve the political discourse more broadly.


Implement proportional representation
-------------------------------------

We see proportional representation as vital to ensuring that government properly represents everyone, and that everyone's voice matters in elections.  We intend to restart the national debate and push for a system of proportional representation to be implemented for all elections in the UK.


Require sensible service contracts
----------------------------------

Private for-profit transport providers have on occasion managed to renegotiate contracts with local and national authorities in order to reduce losses and costs when times have got tougher. These moves are almost always taken in order to protect profits and sometimes occur shortly after being awarded a franchise.  This has led to poorer service to the communities that these providers serve and has harmed the reputation of local and national governments.  We will ensure that private companies that bid to provide public services are held accountable for any breaches of contract.


Rate all spending in pounds per QALY
------------------------------------

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence uses the "Quality Adjusted Life year" (QALY) as a measure of how much good a drug does. To be approved, the drug must buy at least one QALY for each Â£30,000 spent.

We aim to trial the use of pounds per QALY in areas outside of health as an aid in decision making, with a view to rolling it out across all areas of government if it is successful.  Using a uniform measure across defence, policing,  education and all other areas of spending would give the public and government an idea as to where money can be best spent to achieve a rapid benefit. We believe that making explicit the estimates that go into justifying spending might give better results than hiding justifications or using less evidence based methods.


Aim for a balanced budget
-------------------------

Whilst not achievable in the very short term, we support the fact that the UK needs a balanced budget rather than continuous deficit spending.


Make parliament work
--------------------

To improve the quality of legislation we wish to see a much higher level of pre-legislative scrutiny for every bill before parliament.

We would investigate measures intended to reduce the power of the Whips in the Commons.

We would investigate the possibility of permanent elected legislative committees for each government department in the Commons rather than ad hoc public bill committees.  There are a number of approaches that could work in this area and we would aim to trial a number of options to decide which is likely to be the most effective.

We would Implement the rest of the Wright report by creating a House business committee in the Commons and the recommendations of the Goodlad report in full for the Lords.  As well as implementing a House business committee in the Lords and having an evidence-taking stage for all bills in addition to pre-legislative scrutiny.

We would limit the use rules to restrict debate in the Commons to cases of actual abuse of the rules of the House.

We would roll out post-legislative scrutiny on all important policy-changing bills before new bills on the same subject are be considered.

We would require the maintainance of a register of lobbyists as well as a record of all meetings between lobbyists and legislators or government officials.


Full disclosure of government deals with corporations
-----------------------------------------------------

The detail of the government's deals and agreements with suppliers and other businesses should be disclosed. It is not acceptable that the government should be allowed to protect information regarding its commercial activities on the basis of confidentiality.


Independent public spending reviews
-----------------------------------

An independent audit of public sector spending and processes should be carried out annually, with bi-annual review of spending to identify where spending reductions or greater returns are possible without reducing the overall effectiveness of the public sector.


Democratise the City of London
------------------------------

We support the democratisation of the City of London. Given the City's huge impact on the UK it is important that it is accountable and transparent. We support an end to business and corporate block votes in all council elections; the abolition of existing "secrecy practices" within the City, and total and transparent reform of its institutions to end corporate tax evasion; the decommissioning of the City of London police with officers being brought under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan police force; and the abolition of the offices of the Lord Mayor of London, the Sheriffs and the Aldermen.

Finally, we support a commission to examine any corruption, malpractice, or illegal activities within the City or its institutions with the aim of preventing any similar future abuses as well as ensuring that justice is done and seen to be done.


Reform the House of Lords
-------------------------

Reform of the House of Lords is necessary to ensure that the Lords remains relevant and effective as an expert body, and acts as a proper check on the activities of the Commons.  However the scope, scale and specifics of any reform are something that needs to be discussed at length and in public.  We all have a stake in the future shape of of our democracy.

We intend to start a national discussion about the shape of the Lords and how it can be improved without damaging the work that the Lords does.


Demand accountability from government suppliers.
------------------------------------------------

The delivery of services to government is littered with stories of companies exceeding budgets and delivering late.  We will implement penalties for significant performance failures for government suppliers.  If a company fails to deliver a government within 25% of budget or 25% of the deadline then that company (its parent organisations and subsidiaries) would be banned from providing services or products to the government for at least 2 years.
