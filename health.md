Health
======

We must secure the NHS for now and the future. Instead of dogma, the NHS should be about what works. There should be no compulsion to outsource services if they can be more effectively or cheaply provided in house. Doctors must not be burdened with administration. They must be allowed to focus on patients. There must be complete transparency about the decision making for our health service; the risk register must be published.  If we are going to have a cost effective health service available to all, then it must no longer be a blank cheque for big pharmaceutical companies.  We should end drug patents and use the money saved to invest in research and reversing cuts.

We can all make positive choices about our own health.  To help, food labelling should be as clear and easily understandable as possible. Advice on getting healthy should also be available easily, without bias from companies that seek to make money from fitness fads and dietary supplements. We must make sure the ill are not exploited, and crack down on misleading quack and 'miracle' cures.

The use of recreational drugs should be seen as a health issue and the NHS is best placed to help in tackling addiction, educating, and reducing harm to individuals.  This approach must be evidence lead, not subject to knee-jerk reactions or election year promises.

We will not support any charges for access to healthcare, nor could we support any other measure that makes access to care more difficult for people. Our aim should be to help people see a doctor or nurse when they need to, and have access to vaccinations and preventative care.  It will keep us healthier and reduce costs. The health of our young people needs to be protected.  Vaccination schemes should be broadened where it is effective, for instance giving the HPV vaccine to boys as is now recommended.


Securing the NHS for now and the future
---------------------------------------

The Pirate Party will require that any legislative, administrative or other changes to the NHS do not have a negative impact on the NHS's primary principles: that it meet the needs of everyone; that it be free at the point of delivery; and that it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay.

Changes to the NHS should be based upon evidence, not ideology. Changes should come from within the health establishment and the NHS wherever possible, with evolutionary change driven by a continuous, democratic and open discussion within the service.

Where the government is planning privatisation or permitting private provision of services we will ensure that transparency be at least equal to the scrutiny that the public provision it replaces was subject to.  Contracts must ensure that delivery costs are guaranteed with penalties for failure and contingencies to ensure continuity of care.

Health provision is something that should be available to everyone. Like scientific ideas and culture, it is something that should be seen as part of the commons because without it people's freedom to act is limited and pressures can be placed on individuals based on the cost or availability of healthcare, limiting freedom of action and potentially freedom of expression and association.


Abolishing drug patents
-----------------------

We aim to abolish drug patents, which will reduce drug costs drastically, since all drugs would become generic. This innovation would save the NHS vast sums of money; part of that saving will then be used to subsidise drug research.

The pharmaceutical industry currently spends around 15% of its patent drug income on research; we would support that expenditure with subsidies made possible in savings from the NHS.  This will increase research budgets, while still saving the NHS money.

This policy of making all drugs generic will create a massive opportunity for industry to make profits, employ more people and save lives by encouraging the manufacture of newly generic drugs in this country for sale to the third world.


Administration by administrators, medicine from medical staff
-------------------------------------------------------------

Given the complexity of running a hospital and the amount of time involved in administration, administrative staff, must be seen as important to ensuring that doctors, nurses and other medical staff can focus on patient care, rather than being seen as a burden.  Although NHS resources and spending must be scrutinised and transparent, it is important not to harm services by removing administrative staff and shifting the administrative burden to front-line staff.


Bring appropriate support services back into the NHS
----------------------------------------------------

The general public broadly trusts the NHS to deliver services. We all trust the NHS with our lives. In return for that trust, the NHS should ensure that it is using the funds apportioned to it as effectively as possible, even when an effective service isn't the cheapest option.

All the skills to deliver healthcare from start to finish, from cleaning to surgery and from transport to transplants, should be available within the NHS.


Widen public access to Computerised Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CCBT)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A trial to make computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) freely accessible by anyone via the Internet should be undertaken. This resource is available already through the NHS, but you must be referred by a GP to gain access.  If found to be effective it would allow anyone who feels they may benefit by access to do so.  This may help people who are reluctant to go to their GP over mental health concerns get the help they need online for free while maintaining complete anonymity.


Address LGBT health challenges
------------------------------

LGBT people face multiple serious health challenges. The Pirate Party aims to follow the lead of countries like Norway that have comprehensive LGBT public health plans with clear goals. We also need to end the stigma around HIV/AIDS and initiate a national campaign to normalise HIV testing as a routine part of caring for our health.


Equality in blood donation
--------------------------

Restrictions on blood donations from men who have sex with men should be lifted. The focus must be on individual screening and making sure as many people as possible can donate blood and save lives.


Deal with drug abuse as a health issue
--------------------------------------

The abuse of illegal and legal drugs is a health issue, and it should be treated as such. Abusers of drugs should be provided with care, advice and assistance to prevent or reduce dependency, as well as support to ensure that they can operate effectively within society. For these reasons, and because the NHS largely deals with the negative consequences of substance abuse, it would make sense for the NHS to take the lead in both research and providing advice in all areas of drug policy, from the medicinal use of marijuana to the impact or dangers of new recreational drug


An evidence-based approach to alcohol education
-----------------------------------------------

Our current alcohol education methods create the negative response to drinking alcohol.  An evidence based approach to educating young people about alcohol and the impact it would both improve education and make it more likely for those who find that alcohol has a negative impact on their lives to seek help.
