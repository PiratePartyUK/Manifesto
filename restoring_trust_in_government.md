Restoring Trust In Government
-----------------------------

Our democracy is in real danger. All too few people take part and vote. It's time to reverse the trend of just a few people calling the shots. This has to start with trusting young people and bringing in voting from 16. All the main parties promised us long overdue reform of the House of Lords, but seem unable to act due to Westminster bickering. Let's all be involved in working out how we want to be governed, based on equality and fair representation. When all else fails constituents should be able to force a by-election if they have lost confidence in their MP.

It is time to end the "pass the buck culture". It should be transparent who is responsible for which decisions and who will take responsibility when there are problems. We all take responsibility for our actions; it is time that those in government did so too.

We can't ask you to trust the government, but we can promise to work to make government more trustworthy. We should expand 'open data's. Government and council information that concerns us should be shared with us. If our government fails us, people should have the right to expose it and we should protect the rights of whistleblowers.

Freedom of Information laws must be protected, strengthened and expanded. The 'right to know' should apply wherever our money is being spent and that must include private contractors. We've seen how outsourcing can let us down with G4S security for the Olympics, so it is important that it is possible to renegotiate contracts or get rid of suppliers when they fail us.


Increase government transparency and accountability.
----------------------------------------------------

We will introduce a new right for constituents to force a by-election in the event of a loss of confidence in their MP.

We will require minutes of all meetings of officials on government business to be accessible through Freedom of Information requests. We will also aim to ensure that all available information that could be requested under a Freedom of Information request is made public by default.

We will require that all international treaties be passed through the UK parliament as a standard bill, requiring the full approval of both houses.


Votes at 16
-----------

Everyone is affected by government policy, but the disparity between representation and responsibility is greatest between those aged 16, who cannot vote, and those aged 18 who can.

Everything from education policy through to health and social policy can have an immediate effect on 16 year olds have no say in who represents them at a national and local level. At 16 a person can join the Army, but not vote. A 16 year old can work, but not vote. A 16 year old is old enough to be tried in a court and punished for breaking the law, but cannot vote.

Reducing the voting age will also increase the political and democratic engagement of young people. Getting younger people involved in the national debate early, ensuring that they have a stake and a say, should improve the political discourse more broadly.


Implement proportional representation
-------------------------------------

We see proportional representation as vital to ensuring that government properly represents everyone, and that everyone's voice matters in elections.  We intend to restart the national debate and push for a system of proportional representation to be implemented for all elections in the UK.


Require sensible service contracts
----------------------------------

Private for-profit transport providers have on occasion managed to renegotiate contracts with local and national authorities in order to reduce losses and costs when times have got tougher. These moves are almost always taken in order to protect profits and sometimes occur shortly after being awarded a franchise.  This has led to poorer service to the communities that these providers serve and has harmed the reputation of local and national governments.  We will ensure that private companies that bid to provide public services are held accountable for any breaches of contract.


Rate all spending in pounds per QALY
------------------------------------

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence uses the "Quality Adjusted Life year" (QALY) as a measure of how much good a drug does. To be approved, the drug must buy at least one QALY for each Â£30,000 spent.

We aim to trial the use of pounds per QALY in areas outside of health as an aid in decision making, with a view to rolling it out across all areas of government if it is successful.  Using a uniform measure across defence, policing,  education and all other areas of spending would give the public and government an idea as to where money can be best spent to achieve a rapid benefit. We believe that making explicit the estimates that go into justifying spending might give better results than hiding justifications or using less evidence based methods.


Aim for a balanced budget
-------------------------

Whilst not achievable in the very short term, we support the fact that the UK needs a balanced budget rather than continuous deficit spending.


Make parliament work
--------------------

To improve the quality of legislation we wish to see a much higher level of pre-legislative scrutiny for every bill before parliament.

We would investigate measures intended to reduce the power of the Whips in the Commons.

We would investigate the possibility of permanent elected legislative committees for each government department in the Commons rather than ad hoc public bill committees.  There are a number of approaches that could work in this area and we would aim to trial a number of options to decide which is likely to be the most effective.

We would Implement the rest of the Wright report by creating a House business committee in the Commons and the recommendations of the Goodlad report in full for the Lords.  As well as implementing a House business committee in the Lords and having an evidence-taking stage for all bills in addition to pre-legislative scrutiny.

We would limit the use rules to restrict debate in the Commons to cases of actual abuse of the rules of the House.

We would roll out post-legislative scrutiny on all important policy-changing bills before new bills on the same subject are be considered.

We would require the maintainance of a register of lobbyists as well as a record of all meetings between lobbyists and legislators or government officials.


Full disclosure of government deals with corporations
-----------------------------------------------------

The detail of the government's deals and agreements with suppliers and other businesses should be disclosed. It is not acceptable that the government should be allowed to protect information regarding its commercial activities on the basis of confidentiality.


Independent public spending reviews
-----------------------------------

An independent audit of public sector spending and processes should be carried out annually, with bi-annual review of spending to identify where spending reductions or greater returns are possible without reducing the overall effectiveness of the public sector.


Democratise the City of London
------------------------------

We support the democratisation of the City of London. Given the City's huge impact on the UK it is important that it is accountable and transparent. We support an end to business and corporate block votes in all council elections; the abolition of existing "secrecy practices" within the City, and total and transparent reform of its institutions to end corporate tax evasion; the decommissioning of the City of London police with officers being brought under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan police force; and the abolition of the offices of the Lord Mayor of London, the Sheriffs and the Aldermen.

Finally, we support a commission to examine any corruption, malpractice, or illegal activities within the City or its institutions with the aim of preventing any similar future abuses as well as ensuring that justice is done and seen to be done.


Reform the House of Lords
-------------------------

Reform of the House of Lords is necessary to ensure that the Lords remains relevant and effective as an expert body, and acts as a proper check on the activities of the Commons.  However the scope, scale and specifics of any reform are something that needs to be discussed at length and in public.  We all have a stake in the future shape of of our democracy.

We intend to start a national discussion about the shape of the Lords and how it can be improved without damaging the work that the Lords does.


Demand accountability from government suppliers.
------------------------------------------------

The delivery of services to government is littered with stories of companies exceeding budgets and delivering late.  We will implement penalties for significant performance failures for government suppliers.  If a company fails to deliver a government within 25% of budget or 25% of the deadline then that company (its parent organisations and subsidiaries) would be banned from providing services or products to the government for at least 2 years.
