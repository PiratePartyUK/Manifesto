Education
=========

We should have an education system for all. University tuition fees burden students with debt and act as a barrier to access and success. They must be frozen and reversed. Class size guidelines must be enforced for all ages, and schools should be under local democratic control. Free Schools should not be under government control, but have council supervision and local representation on boards. Teachers must be free to focus on teaching, and not bogged down by administration.

We want to see a national curriculum that is about the "what", but not "how", so that schools and teachers can teach in a way that best benefits the student.  Above all, we need to educate a generation of innovators, not idle consumers.

It is important that in an increasingly digital world Computer Science is available in schools.  Children should not be just learning how to use specific software, but how to use the tools and technology that we all now have available to us. At all levels, real world experience and partnerships outside of the classroom and lecture hall should be a core part of learning.

We will encourage the adoption of free and open source software in schools, ensuring that children aren't reliant on using a particular software package from a particular company and that schools aren't locked into using a particular vendor.

Education should be lifelong. Everyone should have a Personal Investment Allowance. If you don't go in to further or higher education straight away, you should be able to do so later in life, when you need new skills or want to change career. The aim of our schools must be rounded development, not learning for exams.

We need to look at what has worked elsewhere too. Scandinavian style 'high schools', which offer 6 month residential courses before higher education without exams to develop students abilities and desire to learn, would provide real benefits to students and the country at large. Alternative methods of grading GCSEs and A-levels, such as percentile based systems, should be explored to make the system fairer and more transparent.


Abolish university tuition fees
-------------------------------

Labour introduced them, the Tories and Lib Dems have increased them too. We will abolish them.


Lifetime access to education 
-----------------------------

The best time to learn is in the earliest years, but for many people life events can mean that they miss out on education, or due to personal issues they may be incapable of taking full advantage of the education available to them up to the age of 18. We are committed to providing easy access to both basic education and higher education for all; we believe that the UK can build on the excellent foundations already laid by the Open University. University tuition fees should be frozen and eventually scrapped.
 Tuition fees have a disproportionately negative effect on students from poorer backgrounds, and act as a barrier to intelligent and willing young people's development to their full academic potential. We believe that a freeze in tuition fees is necessary until a workable grant based, free, or means tested alternative funding method can be agreed on and implemented.


Reduce class sizes
------------------

Class sizes have a measurable impact on the performance of students of all ages.  We would set a maximum class size, not as a guideline, but as a requirement for all schools within the UK with exceptions for schools where parents and governors actively want to see larger class sizes and are using some other methods to mitigate any negative impact.


Invest in teachers
------------------

Schools should have the freedom to spend their budgets as they see fit and should be encouraged to invest in knowledgeable, enthusiastic and well qualified teachers.  Over the last decade we have seen vast sums wasted on expensive school IT systems, often with maintenance, software licensing and other excessive or unnecessary costs attached. To make matters worse, schools are often locked into these costly systems for long periods, reducing schools' abilities to adapt to new technology and provide the best education to their students. An effort needs to be made to ensure that schools are aware of and can collaborate on the use of free and open source software, which could save significant amounts of money within education and redirect it back to teaching.


Abolish requirement for collective worship in schools
-----------------------------------------------------

As it stands, the law requires all schools to hold an act of collective worship every day. Even in schools that aren’t ‘faith’ schools, this must be ‘broadly Christian’ in character. In a society which is increasingly diverse, this is an affront to the rights of young people to express their beliefs freely. Although there is the opportunity to opt out, this is reliant on parental permission and is not respected by all schools. The law is extremely unpopular, with opinion polls showing teachers don’t want it, parents don’t want it, and children don’t want it. As such, it is long past time for the daily act of collective worship to be replaced with inclusive assemblies that add to cohesion and a sense of community within schools. We should encourage schools to hold educational assemblies that will include all children, regardless of religion or non-religious belief.


Let all schools access a national media library
-----------------------------------------------

The BBC, National Archives and other appropriate groups should be asked to establish a national media library for educational establishments.  A large catalogue of material for students and teachers to make use of would diversify and increase the quality of media material available in education and would save money by centralising administration and technical costs.


Make publicly funded academic research available to all 
--------------------------------------------------------

We believe that it is vital that the results of academic research produced in universities that receive public money should be available to all, in accordance with the Budapest Open Access Initiative.

We support the existing government policy that all academic research funded or partially funded by the taxpayer via the UK Research Councils is published under a CC-BY license.

We will ensure that the policy is enforced, and encourage the research councils to set up central subject-specific repositories similar to the UKPubMed database for deposit of manuscripts.


Reduce the school leaving age
-----------------------------

We will investigate making education after the age of 14 voluntary.   An initial trial where any 14-year-old who can pass a GCSE in Maths and English should be permitted to pursue a job or apprenticeship offer, with the option of returning to school if they lose their placement or would prefer to return to education.

This would allow young people who want to start working early or specialise as apprentices to remove themselves from classes, freeing up time and resources for those who would prefer to continue in education.


Switch to a percentile-based grading system
-------------------------------------------

We will assess the effectiveness of a percentile based grading system to avoid grade inflation, to minimise the impact of arbitrary changes to grading criteria, and to ensure that exam results remain comparable in the long term.


'Set up a business' experience
------------------------------

We will trial a programme where 16-year-olds are encouraged to set up a small business as part of a work experience programme during or at the end of their final year of school.  The programme would aim to actually establish viable businesses and provide the skills and experience required to run a small business.


Teach entrepreneurial skills in schools
---------------------------------------

Schools should prepare children for life after education.  With the support of school governors and parents, schools should have the option of providing entrepreneurial skills as part of their curriculum.

In our current economic system it is important that children to learn about competition, taking risks and strategy.


Reinstate the Education Maintenance Allowance in England
--------------------------------------------------------

The Education Maintenance Allowance should be reinstated until a broader and tested alternative can be introduced to ensure that 16 to 18-year-olds in low-income families who are staying on at school can afford to study for A-levels. This would bring England back in line with in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.


Have a national curriculum that says 'What' but not 'How'
---------------------------------------------------------

Schools should have the freedom to choose the teaching methods and materials they feel are most effective to ensure that their students are well equipped once they have completed their education.  Decisions about what is taught and how should be as local as possible in all instances, and limitations on local decision making should be kept to a minimum.


Eliminate school rankings by GCSE or SAT results
------------------------------------------------

Schools must aim to educate, not to simply pass exams.  The number of examinations that young people sit should be reduced, and schools should be judged on a broad range of indicators.      Moreover, the examinations that young people sit should be appropriate to their aims and future development. Schools should not push students toward particular subjects or qualifications for any reason other than the students' wishes and abilities. The public ranking of schools by GCSE or SAT results should be discontinued.
