Justice
=======

A justice system that isn't available to everyone is not a justice system at all.  The current trend towards setting up barriers to access is worrying, and we want to see it stopped. Cuts to legal aid must be reversed, to preserve access for the most vulnerable in our society. Instead, legal fees should be capped.

We deserve an impartial justice system, accountable police officers and a fair system for dealing with those convicted of offences.

Public consent is the cornerstone of such a justice system. Much is made of community policing, but priorities need to be set with the whole community, not just a few people. Consultation and involvement needs to be more inclusive, seeking out groups who are under-represented. Agreed priorities should be updated regularly and set out clearly.  CCTV is becoming ever more intrusive and expensive, but it is far from effective. Money wasted on cameras should be used to reverse police cuts.

There should not be any political interference in the everyday working of the police, and the expensive Tory imposed police commissioners should be abolished. The CPS and Director of Public Prosecution's duty to consider public interest in prosecutions should be strengthened. We must see an end to costly and unnecessary cases like the Twitter Joke Trial. An action plan should be prepared on how to reduce deaths in custody and through contacts with the police.

Unjust extradition arrangements must also be reworked to protect our citizens from disproportionate and inappropriate requests from foreign governments. In particular, the current UK-US treaty is weighted against British citizens, and is due for change to protect us all.


Reverse legal aid cuts
----------------------

Justice should be equal for all in the UK, and that includes access to justice, regardless of income or background.  The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill will cut millions from the Legal Aid budget leaving victims out in the cold.  The Pirate Party will reverse cuts to legal aid brought in by the LASPO bill, affecting domestic violence, immigration, employment, debt, welfare benefit, divorce, and welfare benefits.


Maintain independence of the Judiciary, CPS and the Police
----------------------------------------------------------

Politicians should pass laws that they feel appropriate, but it should be the role of the police and judges to act independently, neither aiming to influence nor being swayed by political or popular pressures.  The limiting of the independence of judges, and the curtailment of their ability to make the right judgement and to pass appropriate sentences on cases that come before them can and does constitute an injustice.  The police should act on the basis of priorities that are right for the areas in which they are operating. They should not be pushed to prioritise their resources or change the way they police on the basis of political demands.


Ensure the police are effective
-------------------------------

The number of police officers should reflect the needs of the area in which they operate. However, every police force should have the resources to ensure that police officers are both highly visible and available when they are needed.  The numbers and balance of Police Community Support Officers and Police Officers in every force area should be sufficient to achieve that goal.


No to Police Commissioners
--------------------------

The election of Police Commissioners will be a step backward for justice in Britain.  Whilst we support the idea that those individuals entrusted with upholding and enforcing the law should be open to public scrutiny, we do not believe that they should be elected to their offices and subject to political pressure. The Pirate Party will abolish Police Commissioners.


Improve the rehabilitation of offenders
---------------------------------------

We will introduce significant reforms to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. The current recidivism rate in the UK is around 50%, in part due to discrimination against former prisoners after release.  The Pirate Party will propose removing the requirement to declare spent criminal convictions and toughen legislation making it illegal to discriminate against people with spent convictions.


Make extradition fair
---------------------

No extradition should be permitted where a British Judges deems that an extradition would not be in the interests of justice.  We will ensure that British judges have the power to halt an extradition until they were satisfied that a case is trial-ready, as well as the power to refuse extradition where the country seeking extradition is clearly not the appropriate place for trial.

We would also seek clearer rules to deal with cases where there is a multinational aspect to ensure cases are handled transparently and fairly.

We would address the perceived imbalance in the US-UK extradition treaty by requiring that the standards for extradition being granted and the information required to assess each case are the same whether an extradition request comes from the US or the UK. Any extradition treaty must not only be fair, but be seen to be fair.
