Economy and Jobs
================

The UK is in a dire financial position right now, We have not managed to dig ourselves out of the hole caused by the bank crisis under Labour, and many of us are still suffering from the consequences. We have not put protections in place to prevent the same mistakes from happening again. We must hold the banks to account.  Banks and their management should be liable for catastrophic mistakes, so that they take greater care with our money.

The Government wants to stop short of this. It is time for strict liability for bank directors to prevent our economy from being treated like a casino.

The tax system should be clear and transparent and focused on jobs and innovation.  We need to take action to reduce tax avoidance and act on tax evasion.  A dedicated tax minister with clear responsibilities to us all would help to make sure all businesses and individuals are playing their part and that no group faces an excessive burden.

It is important to realise that we can't simply borrow or tax-cut our way to growth: we have to invent our way to it. We need to focus on what works.  Small businesses provide a massive amount of employment and tax revenue We should ensure that they are not prevented from innovating but encouraged to do so.

We need a better ways to reduce poverty and support people when they need support.  We will be investigating how a Citizens Income could be implemented in the UK and will promote reforms that would lead to such a scheme being the back bone of welfare reform in the future.

We see more economic activity and more jobs from small firms, yet tax breaks are more available to large corporates.  Not only is that unfair, but it is promoting businesses that aren't beneficial to the UK at the cost of supporting those that are.

The economy is built upon education and individual effort. We need to empower individuals. School should not just be about work experience but about "creating your own job" experience.  We must remove Intellectual Property laws that are hampering growth. It's time to stop the tide of over-reaching patents and trivial lawsuits that are tying up new ideas and start-ups.


Fair Tax brackets
-----------------

There are continuous debates about the specifics of tax brackets as well as arguments around when they should be increased or lowered.  We will propose a scheme whereby income tax brackets and personal allowances are calculated as multiples or fractions of the median income and float with the economy.  As the economy improves, more people on low incomes would be removed from the tax system; if the economy deteriorates taxes increase for all, but with a smaller impact at the bottom of the income scale. Individuals earning less than half of the national median income will not pay income taxes.


Reform the patents system
-------------------------

We believe that patents exist to reward the inventors of truly outstanding ideas, not to allow big businesses to stifle competition with an ever-growing tide of trivial, incomprehensible, overreaching patents.

We will stop the abuse of patent law by raising the bar on how innovative an idea has to be before it can be patented, and by prohibiting patents on software, business methods, concepts and works of nature.

We will require a working model to exist before a patent is granted and we will strictly enforce the current rule that patents are invalid if they are "obvious to someone skilled in the art".

We will allow and encourage more competition in the manufacturing of patented devices by introducing a system of compulsory patent licensing, and we will provide exemptions to patent law for non-commercial use, personal study and academic research.


Personal liability for directors
--------------------------------

Directors of large public companies should have a personal liability for their actions and decisions.  This move will ensure that there is a greater personal incentive for the leadership of large business beyond a short term financial incentive.


A “Robin Hood Tax” on financial institutions
--------------------------------------------

A tiny tax on stock market transactions would raise significant revenue and act as a disincentive to engage in activities like high-frequency trading.  It will be our aim to promote a coordinated international effort to implement such a scheme.


Create jobs
-----------

The current approach to economic stimulus (providing large amounts of money to certain institutions in the hope that it will eventually lead to increased lending and so the expansion of businesses and the creation of jobs) is not effective.  It gives an advantage to a specific sector of our economy by allowing the financial sector to shape the economy of the UK more broadly.  The economy will only recover when people have secure jobs and enough money to live, spend in the economy, and invest in their pensions and savings.  Making large numbers of people redundant in the hope that the private sector will simply create jobs is not the right course of action. We will advocate a more direct approach to economic recovery and creating jobs.

The UK faces a number of challenges, from a lack of social housing to poor transport and communications links, that could be dealt with by initiating infrastructure projects.  The product of such infrastructure projects would provide a long term benefit to the UK and stimulate future growth.  We could increase the rate of high speed broadband expansion, improve public transport (particularly outside London) and make Britain a world leader in renewable energy. This will allow us to reduce unemployment and provide skills to people who have lost jobs in other parts of the economy.


Make work, work
---------------

Currently, 1 in 3 young people in the UK live in poverty, and 1 in 5 young adults are unemployed, yet even when they do find work at the minimum wage, they are paid far less than older workers. Nobody should be costed out of an adequate standard of living, especially not on the basis of age. We will object to discrimination within the benefits system for anyone not in full time education or retirement.


Implement a land value tax
--------------------------

The tax system is broken and too easily evaded. A land value tax would raise more from the rich without penalising the poor, whilst at the same time being much harder to dodge than traditional income tax. It would also support economic productivity, as those who rely on existing assets for income would be charged, whereas those who work for a living would not. The Pirate Party would support a land value tax.


No-one will pay more tax than those earning more than them
----------------------------------------------------------

Taxation should be fair to the taxpayer. Those earning the least should not only pay a smaller amount of money in tax, but should always have a lower marginal tax rate than those earning more than they do.  That marginal tax rate should apply to all taxes on income, whether from employment, investments or other instruments.

We would aim to simplify the tax system to ensure that the tax system is as fair as possible. We want everyone to keep as much of the money that they earn as we can, but it is vital that it is the impact of taxation that is fair, not simply the amounts involved.


Remove commercial restrictions on suburbia
------------------------------------------

It is important that local and national governments do not prevent people from setting up businesses or innovating. We will ensure that there are no unreasonable barriers preventing home-owners from making the best possible use of their houses and gardens for work. We believe it is important that, within existing limitations on noise and environmental harm, we remove restrictions that prevent people from doing business from and with their homes


Encourage entrepreneurship through micro-businesses
---------------------------------------------------

We will promote micro-business as a driver for innovation and competition in the British economy. A micro-business is a very small business with a single owner and no employees, one with a turnover of less than £2500/year.

The first £1500 of income earned from micro-business would be tax free, nor would the income from such an operation have an impact on benefits.


Reduce tax evasion
------------------

To reduce tax evasion, we will aim to increase penalties for engaging in schemes aimed to evade tax unlawfully.  The penalty for tax evasion should be sufficiently punitive that getting caught once outweighs the benefits of having engaged in evasion over a period of years.


Put the Treasury's economic models online
-----------------------------------------

Hiding economic data and the basis on which predictions are made is bad for confidence and makes it harder anyone to challenge the decisions made by government. The Pirate Party will ensure that information that aids analysis and planning, like the Treasury's economic models, are available to anyone via the Internet or at request.


No more bank bailouts
---------------------

The bailing out of British banks during and shortly after the bank crisis by the government may have shored up some banks, but at a huge cost.  We dont think that banks should be allowed to profit from risky behaviour.

We must draw a line under the 'too big to fail culture' and resolve that the UK taxpayer is no longer required to prop-up incompetent or overstretched banks. There should be no more 'bankers' bailouts.

The government should still guarantee the deposits of savers at high street banks via an insurance scheme, but the focus of any intervention must be the banks' customers, not the banks themselves or their shareholders. To make it less likely that retail banks become insolvent, we will propose limitations on their activities and introduce personal liability for their directors, as well as encouraging shareholders in promoting safe practices.


Make pensions fairer
--------------------

At present pensions providers are taking large amounts of the money that individuals save for their retirement in fees and commissions, often with a lack of clarity as to what such fees are for or whether they will be applied at all.

Given the importance of saving for retirement, we would aim to dis-incentivise providers from charging excessive fees and ensure that any costs associated are clearly stated up front. All pension funds should have to state their costs in a clear, unobfuscated way at the point when a pension is set up.  We will introduce a right to move pension savings to providers with lower overheads without penalty.

We will work to reduce the cost of saving for retirement and try to ensure that everyone in the UK has access to quality pension products. All pension schemes must recognise same sex couples, and provide what pensioners need.


Bring in a tax minister
-----------------------

The UK's tax system is overcomplicated. There is a lack of clear responsibility for regulatory and implementation failures, and failures in the administration of tax credits is often seen as an administrative fact of life.  We will aim to make it much clearer who is responsible for the collection and administration of our tax system by appointing a Tax minister.

Our Tax minister's brief will be to simplify the tax system and to ensure that its administration is as efficient as possible whilst also putting a face on a system that is often seen as faceless, bureaucratic and unfair.


Require subsidy matching
------------------------

Many industries that are essential to the United Kingdom (including rail, water, electricity generation and supply, gas supply and other utilities) have been privatised in recent decades, but continue to rely on massive government subsidy for infrastructure investment.  These private organisations then take millions in support whilst continuing to provide dividends to their shareholders and massive pay and benefits to their senior staff.

We believe that this is unfair. Where the government spends the taxpayers' money to ensure the delivery of an essential service, the taxpayer should expect to see a return for their money before private investors are paid dividends. Senior management should have their wages capped.

In addition we will propose that any government subsidy or grant to a profit-making company for the delivery of services should be met pound-for-pound by private investment.


Carry out trademark reform
--------------------------

All trademarks should be equal in law.  There should be no special exceptions for particular trademarks or organisations, and special protection for Olympic related marks should be removed.


Move toward a Citizens Income
-----------------------------

Instead of bailing out banks, and channelling money through them to increase spending in the economy, help needs to get directly to those who are creating new ideas and new jobs.  However, it is not just a question of creating any old jobs; the focus of our economy should be jobs with a living wage. A vast number of people in the UK are paid less than what is required to live above poverty levels in their area. These people then need government support, essentially providing a subsidy for employers.

We would lift these people out of the poverty trap, firstly by ensuring that the minimum wage is a living wage wherever you live in the UK, and secondly by unifying and simplifying the benefits system with the eventual aim of implementing a Citizens Income for all British citizens.
