The European Union
==================

Given that self determination is one of the fundamental principles that we believe in, we believe that a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU should be offered to voters in the UK, and that such a referendum should include the option for the UK to pull out of the EU and negotiate it's own agreements with the EU as a whole or with individual member states.

The EU should live up to its own principles on subsidiarity and decisions should not be taken at an EU level if they can be better resolved on a national, regional or local level.

It is important that the EU increase it's level of transparency and openness and that these principles should inform the EU's politics, organisation and administration. In the absence of transparency and openness accountability becomes questionable at best and the lack of accountability that is one of our primary concerns with the EU.

To ensure that the European Union is accountable to its members and citizens, it is vital that there is scrutiny of the European Council by national parliaments.
 The UK should not adopt the Euro as currency nor aim for it's adoption.  No EU member state should be required to join the Euro, or agree to join in future as a requirement of membership.  The weaknesses of monetary union in the context of the EU have been made more than clear and without being resolved, it is obvious that some countries, their economies and citizens, would not benefit from closer monetary union.

We will rebalance power within the EU toward elected representatives and away from the Council of Ministers and Commission. For the EU to function properly and in the interests of its members, the influence of anonymous civil servants in the creation of policy must be minimised.

We do not support the imposition of EU data retention laws on the UK, they should be repealed at the EU level and should not be should be implemented in the UK.

We do not support the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive (IPRED), an attempt by the European Union to increase penalties and eventually criminalise commercial copyright and patent infractions within the EU.  IPRED which includes confiscatory and subpoena powers to copyright holders in civil cases should be repealed and attempts to bring forward IPRED2 should be halted.

SWIFT data, passenger records should not be permitted to leave the EU without a concrete suspicion of crime that is punishable within the EU state the data originated.
