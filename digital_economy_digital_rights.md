Digital Economy and Digital Rights
==================================

Everybody should benefit from the digital revolution. At the moment the UK is behind the curve.  Rather than focusing on access and capability, the Government has decided to limit our rights online, hampering our ability to make use of the internet to its fullest and hamstringing business.

We need to invest in truly world class infrastructure. The goal is fibre to every home and business, and public WiFi where it is needed. The rolling out of public WiFi is a priority and, like street lighting, it is possible if we want it to happen. Together we can get Britain connected.

Laws like the Digital Economy Act threaten to cut off whole families from digital opportunity, all to support businesses that have failed to adapt to the reality of a connected world.  It's time to stop the blocking of web sites. It is arbitrary censorship with no positive benefits. Rather than putting unnecessary burdens on digital businesses, we can get the real digital economy moving, creating new jobs and encouraging small businesses to export internationally via the Internet. We can grow the digital economy and make it possible for all to take part.

Consumers should be protected. The problem of misleading broadband advertising should be tackled, with a right to pay only for the broadband connectivity actually delivered. The 'locking' of electronic devices should be seen as anti-competitive. The principle of a neutral and open Internet should be protected. That is how business and our shared culture will grow.


Broadband access for all
------------------------

At present every person in the UK has access to basic telephone services, so BT or, if you live in Hull, Kingston Communications, must provide you with a fixed phone service at an affordable price. If you are disabled, providers have additional responsiblities to ensure that you have access to communications.  We will extend the requirement to provide basic telephone services to a requirement to provide a minimum level of broadband service and extend this responsibility to all providers who operate in the UK.

We know that the UK's future success depends on a modern broadband infrastructure supporting a free and open Internet, but to make the most of it we must aim to end the "Digital Divide" and ensure that everyone benefits of being part of a connected information society.


Provide public WiFi
-------------------

We will promote the provision of free public WiFi as well as the provision of Internet access in community centres and libraries by local authorities. At present a significant portion of us have limited access to the Internet and the benefits that access provides. Providing access where it is otherwise limited is a good initial step to reducing and eventually ending the digital divide.


Achieve significant copyright reform
------------------------------------

A fair and balanced copyright regime that is suitable for the 21st century is an absolute necessity for the UK to remain competitive in a global economy that is built upon ideas and innovation. Copyright should give artists and innovators the chance to make money from their work; however, that needs to be balanced with the rights of society as a whole.


Reduce copyright terms
----------------------

We will reduce the duration of copyright to 10 years, closer to the original duration of 14 years, reflecting the much greater ease with which works can now be made and distributed.

Shorter copyright will encourage artists to keep on creating new work; will allow new art forms, such as mash-ups; and will stop big businesses from relying on large back-catalogues rather than investing in new content.

Our 10 year copyright length will include within it a renewal after 5 years, allowing works in which the creator is no longer interested to fall into the public domain after 5 years.


Prevent 'restarting the clock'
------------------------------

By ensuring that new copyrights are not created unless the new work represents a substantial change, we will remove the loophole in current copyright law that allows 'restarting the clock' by simply moving content to a new format or making an incremental change to it.


More rights over media
----------------------

We will legalise the use of copyright works where no money changes hands, which will return to the people various rights including:

A right to “format shift” (for example, buying a CD then copying it to a portable media player such as an MP3 player or phone);

A right to share files between friends and peers (which provides free advertising that is essential for less well-known artists);

We will help create an environment in which we can all enjoy and share our cultural heritage free from the threat of legal action or censorship.


Limit digital rights management
-------------------------------

There is an urgent need to raise public awareness about Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology. We believe the public needs to be protected from products that can be remotely turned off by the manufacturer, products that 'phone home' and would therefore stop working if the manufacturer went bankrupt, or products that are 'region coded'.  We will require that any product sold in the UK that includes a DRM mechanism is stored in without DRM in escrow against a time where access to DRM versions is no longer possible.


Fix the Digital Economy Act
---------------------------

We will repeal sections 3 to 18 of the Digital Economy Act 2010 and strengthen the current protections against excessive or frivolous lawsuits for copyright infringement.


Expand the Open Government License
----------------------------------

The Open Government Licence will be expanded to all government funded data and material. All maps, statistics and other data that have been created or collated by the government will be released in open formats, giving the public access to research for which they have already paid. An exception will be made for cases that have national security or privacy concerns.


Make national events accessible
-------------------------------

The current list of important national events that cannot be exclusively broadcast by pay TV services must be maintained and expanded. We will introduce a mandate that such events be available via both broadcast and online distribution.


Implement the Open Source Action Plan
-------------------------------------

The government's existing but widely ignored Open Source Action Plan will be properly implemented across government, and will be promoted to the public and private sectors. The Action Plan encourages the use of free and open source software, saving money where practical and economically viable.


Unbundle technology
-------------------

The bundling of services with hardware has created artificial barriers to entry in a number of markets in the last decade.  To ensure that innovation is possible and to improve competition we would aim to introduce a requirement that the providers of bundled services, software and hardware products price and offer each component individually as well as in a bundle.

We will treat locking of electronic devices, whether the locking of software to hardware or hardware to a service, as an anti-competitive act.
