Foreword by the Leader of Pirate Party UK
=========================================

Democracy is in crisis in the United Kingdom. Whether it is online or on the doorstep, people are telling us that they feel alienated, ignored, that they have given up voting as it changes nothing.

It's this sense of powerlessness over the forces that shape our lives and the space around us that is so worrying in the UK today. Creeping privatisation means all aspects of our society are being divided up and parcelled out. It can be impossible to find out who is responsible for the most basic aspects of our environment, public spaces and services, let alone get anyone to do anything about it.

We are constantly under surveillance, whether it is by Europe's biggest army of CCTV cameras or by companies like ATOS checking up on us. In a country of physical barriers, many find the online world a place to reclaim some freedom. But here too we are increasingly to be watched and restricted, while government and courts gather powers to disconnect us, block websites and monitor what we say and do.

At the heart of Pirate Party politics is the right for everyone to share knowledge and take an equal part in society. That is the way to take control over the world around us. That is what we are setting out here.

This document is the result of the input and debate of thousands of people. It's the UK's first crowd-sourced manifesto. I've always believed in a politics that is done with people not to people, this is what we have delivered here. The process has been exciting not just because it has been unique in British politics, but also because it has resulted in a manifesto that really does offer a chance to break the cycle of alienation and powerlessness.

The result is a broad range of principles, that I and our candidates will be proud to stand on.

I know I'll be proud to support holding banks to account, and getting money to where it is needed in the economy.

I am proud to support securing the NHS for now and the future, and acting against pharmaceutical company greed.

I am proud to support an education system that is life long and values knowledge and development not tests and benchmarks.

I am proud to support extending the scope of Freedom of Information and open data.

I am proud to argue for government based on facts and evidence, not anecdote and lazy ideology.

The core of the Pirate Party's beliefs remain unchanged. That digital rights belong at the heart of politics. That civil liberties need strengthening and defending. That freedom of speech is vital for a thriving democracy. That intellectual property laws must be updated to keep pace with technology.

This manifesto builds on the principles that are our foundation. This is a journey we will continue on, to make a whole range of proposals for a country where everyone really can get their fair share.

We seem to live in an age where politicians promise much, but all too often stand for nothing. There can be no doubt what the Pirate Party stands for. We stand to break the feeling of powerlessness in British politics, to truly give people their own voice.
